With over a decade in the HR Tech industry, I donâ€™t have a silver bullet for all problems. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me an asset for any HR tech B2B SaaS company (let me know if you know the original quote).

Working in organizations scaling from 60 to 400 employees as well as 25-30 employees, my goal has always been to create products that not only meet market needs but also anticipate future trends, ensuring sustainable value for customers, end users and stakeholders.
