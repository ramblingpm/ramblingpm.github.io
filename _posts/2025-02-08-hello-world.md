I guess ***Hello World!*** is what every first blog post should have as a title. I'm not sure what exactly the future posts and pages will contain, but I do know I want to try to get some of my ramblings out of my head <!--more-->  and at the same time work more with git and low level coding.

That is why I decided to host it directly on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and not somewhere else. The blog uses jekyll as the framework and when added as a public repository on github it automagically shares the static pages publicly to the world.

So there is a high likelyhood that some of the pages written from an Ipad or Iphone directly in the github repo, will be edited at a later stage since it actually writing directly to prod (even on a Friday).
