## Hello World!

I guess that is what every first blog post should have as a header. I'm not sure where exactly the posts and pages will contain, but I do know I want to try to get some of my ramblings out of my head and at the same time work more with git and low level coding.

That is why I decided to host it directly on github and not somewhere else. The blog uses jekyll as the framework and when added as a public repository on github it automagically shares the static pages publicly to the world.

So there is a high likelyhood that some of the pages written from an ipad or iphone directly in the github repo, will be edited at a later stage since it actually writing directly to prod (even on a Friday).
